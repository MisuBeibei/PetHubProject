# PetHub_Project03

## App Description

This app is a full-stack login/authorization app using the MERN stack (MongoDB for our database, Express and Node for our backend, and React for our frontend). Weâ€™ll also integrate Redux for state management for our React components.  We are making a call to an API that provides adoptable pets within a provided zipcode.  The user has the option of viewing where the pet is located on google maps
